May the prayers of blessed Mary Magdalen help us, O Lord, Who were moved by her~
prayers and brought back alive from the grave her brother Lazarus, dead for four~
days.

[Lectio]
Lesson from the book of Canticles
!Song 3:2-5; 8:6-7
I will rise and go about the city; in the streets and crossings I will seek Him Whom my heart loves. I sought Him but I did not find Him. The watchmen came upon me as they made their rounds of the city: Have you seen Him Whom my heart loves? I had hardly left them when I found Him Whom my heart loves. I took hold of Him and would not let Him go till I should bring Him to the home of my mother, to the room of my parent, I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and hinds of the field, do not arouse, do not stir up love before its own time. Set me as a seal on Your heart, as a seal on Your arm; for stern as death is love, relentless as the nether world is devotion; its flames are a blazing fire. Deep waters cannot quench love, nor floods sweep it away. Were one to offer all he owns to purchase love, he would despise it as nothing.

[Secreta]
O Lord, may our gifts be acceptable to You through the glorious merits of~
blessed Mary Magdalen, whose offering of homage Your only-begotten Son did~
mercifully accept.
$Qui tecum

[Postcommunio]
After receiving Your Body and precious Blood, the one and only saving remedy, we~
beseech You, O Lord, that, under the protection of blessed Mary Magdalen, we may~
be freed from all evils.
